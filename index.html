<h2 style="color: aqua;">The darkweb has been a major threat to the society most people are unaware of this
    threat.<br>

    BEFORE WE PROCEED LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE DARKWEB MEANS OR HOW IT FUNCTIONS

<h3 style="color: aquamarine;">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
    This article is about darknet websites. For the part of the Internet not accessible by traditional web search
    engines, see Deep web. For the comic book storyline, see Dark Web (Marvel Comics).
    The dark web is the World Wide Web content that exists on darknets (overlay networks) that use the Internet but
    require specific software, configurations, or authorization to access.[1][2][3][4] Through the dark web, private
    computer networks can communicate and conduct business anonymously without divulging identifying information,
    such
    as a user's location.[5][6] The dark web forms a small part of the deep web, the part of the web not indexed by
    web
    search engines, although sometimes the term deep web is mistakenly used to refer specifically to the dark
    web.[7][2][8]<br>
    <br>
    The darknets which constitute the dark web include small, friend-to-friend networks, as well as large, popular
    networks such as Tor, Hyphanet, I2P, and Riffle operated by public organizations and individuals.[6] Users of
    the
    dark web refer to the regular web as clearnet due to its unencrypted nature.[9] The Tor dark web or
    onionland[10]
    uses the traffic anonymization technique of onion routing under the network's top-level domain suffix .onion.

    A December 2014 study by Gareth Owen from the University of Portsmouth found that the most commonly hosted type
    of<br>
    content on Tor was child pornography, followed by black markets, while the individual sites with the highest
    traffic<br>
    were dedicated to botnet operations (see attached metric).[21] Many whistleblowing sites maintain a presence[22]
    as<br>
    well as political discussion forums.[23] Sites associated with Bitcoin, fraud-related services, and mail
    order<br>
    services are some of the most prolific.[21]<br>
    <br>
    As of December 2020, the number of active Tor sites in .onion was estimated at 76,300 (containing a lot of
    copies).
    Of these, 18 000 would have original content.[24]<br>
    <br>
    In July 2017, Roger Dingledine, one of the three founders of the Tor Project, said that Facebook is the
    biggest<br>
    hidden service. The dark web comprises only 3% of the traffic in the Tor network.[25]<br>
    <br>
    A February 2016 study from researchers at King's College London gives the following breakdown of content by
    an<br>
    alternative category set, highlighting the illicit use of .onion services.[17][26]
